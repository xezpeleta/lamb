# User Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added user deletion functionality to the Organization Admin panel, allowing organization administrators to permanently remove users from their organization.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `/opt/lamb/backend/lamb/owi_bridge/owi_users.py`
Added `delete_user()` method to `OwiUserManager` class:
- Deletes users from both the `user` and `auth` tables in the OWI database
- Prevents deletion of the admin user (user ID 1)
- Prevents users from deleting themselves
- Returns `True` on success, `False` on failure
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

```python
def delete_user(self, email: str) -> bool:
    """
    Delete a user from the database (user and auth tables)
    
    Args:
        email (str): User's email
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if user was deleted successfully, False otherwise
    """
```

#### 2. `/opt/lamb/backend/creator_interface/organization_router.py`
Added new DELETE endpoint for user deletion:

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /creator/admin/org-admin/users/{user_id}`

**Features:**
- Verifies organization admin access
- Prevents users from deleting themselves
- Prevents deletion of organization admins/owners
- Verifies user belongs to the organization
- Calls `OwiUserManager.delete_user()` to remove user from auth system
- Returns appropriate error messages for various failure scenarios

**Security Checks:**
1. Authentication and authorization verification
2. Self-deletion prevention
3. Admin/owner role check
4. Organization membership verification

### Frontend Changes

#### `/opt/lamb/frontend/svelte-app/src/routes/org-admin/+page.svelte`

**Added `deleteUser()` function:**
- Prevents users from deleting themselves
- Implements double confirmation dialog for safety
- Calls the DELETE endpoint
- Updates the UI by removing the deleted user from the list
- Provides user feedback via alert messages

**UI Updates:**
- Added red trash/delete icon button in the Actions column
- Icon is disabled (grayed out) when viewing your own user account
- Delete button appears next to existing "Change Password" and "Enable/Disable" buttons
- Uses Heroicons trash icon for consistency

**User Experience:**
- First confirmation: Warning message about permanent deletion
- Second confirmation: Requires user to confirm they want to proceed
- Success/error alerts provide clear feedback
- Deleted user is immediately removed from the users table

## Security Features

1. **Self-Protection**: Users cannot delete their own accounts
2. **Role Protection**: Organization admins and owners cannot be deleted without first removing their privileges
3. **Organization Isolation**: Users can only delete users within their own organization
4. **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid authentication token
5. **Authorization Check**: Only organization admins can access the delete endpoint

## Usage

### For Organization Admins:

1. Navigate to Organization Admin panel: `http://localhost:5173/org-admin?view=users`
2. Find the user you want to delete in the users table
3. Click the red trash icon in the Actions column
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog prompts
5. User will be permanently removed from the system

### API Usage:

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:8000/creator/admin/org-admin/users/123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <org_admin_token>'
```

## Response Format

**Success:**
```json
{
  "message": "User user@example.com has been permanently deleted"
}
```

**Error Examples:**
```json
{
  "detail": "You cannot delete your own account. Please ask another administrator to delete your account if needed."
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Cannot delete an organization admin or owner. Please remove their admin privileges first."
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "User not found in this organization"
}
```

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. Log in as an organization admin
2. Create a test user in your organization
3. Navigate to the Users view in Org Admin panel
4. Try to delete the test user
5. Verify the user is removed from the list
6. Try to log in as the deleted user (should fail)

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Delete a regular user (should succeed)
- ✅ Try to delete yourself (should be prevented)
- ✅ Try to delete an organization admin (should be prevented)
- ✅ Try to delete a user from another organization (should be prevented)
- ✅ Verify UI updates after deletion
- ✅ Verify user cannot log in after deletion

## Database Impact

When a user is deleted:
- Record removed from `auth` table (prevents login)
- Record removed from `user` table (removes user data)
- User ID may still be referenced in `lamb_users` table as a soft reference
- Any assistants, chats, or other content created by the user may remain in the system

## Notes

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Consider implementing a soft delete or archival system for production use if user data recovery is needed
- The admin user (user ID 1) cannot be deleted to protect system integrity
- Frontend files have been rebuilt and copied to `/opt/lamb/backend/static/frontend/`

## Files Modified

1. `/opt/lamb/backend/lamb/owi_bridge/owi_users.py`
2. `/opt/lamb/backend/creator_interface/organization_router.py`
3. `/opt/lamb/frontend/svelte-app/src/routes/org-admin/+page.svelte`

## Build Status

- ✅ Backend Python syntax validated
- ✅ Frontend built successfully
- ✅ Static files copied to backend
- ✅ Ready for testing
