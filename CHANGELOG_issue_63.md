# Fix for Issue #63: Default Prompt Template for New Assistants

## Problem
The Prompt Template field is critical for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to function properly. Previously, if users left this field empty when creating a new assistant, the RAG feature couldn't operate as intended.

## Solution
Added a clear, user-friendly default prompt template that is automatically populated when creating new assistants.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Default Configuration Files

**File**: `/backend/static/json/defaults.json`
- Changed default `system_prompt` from Spanish to English for broader accessibility
- Updated `prompt_template` with a clearer template that:
  - Includes placeholders for `{user_input}` and `{context}`
  - Provides clear instructions for the AI
  - Instructs the AI to respond in the same language as the user's question
- Simplified `rag_placeholders` format to `["{context}", "{user_input}"]`

**Default Template**:
```
User question:
{user_input}

Relevant context:
{context}

- Please provide a clear and helpful answer based only on the context above.
- If the context does not contain enough information, say so clearly.
- Always respond in the same language used in the user question
```

### 2. Enhanced AssistantForm Component

**File**: `/frontend/svelte-app/src/lib/components/assistants/AssistantForm.svelte`
- Modified `resetFormFieldsToDefaults()` function to:
  - Always provide a default prompt template for new assistants
  - Include a fallback template if configuration doesn't load
  - Add logging to track when default is applied
- **Important**: The `populateFormFields()` function remains unchanged, ensuring existing assistants with empty prompt templates are NOT modified

### 3. Updated Fallback Defaults

**File**: `/frontend/svelte-app/src/lib/stores/assistantConfigStore.js`
- Updated hardcoded fallback defaults to match the improved template
- Added `rag_placeholders` to fallback configuration for consistency
- Ensures users always have a working default even if configuration files fail to load

### 4. Added Unit Tests

**File**: `/frontend/svelte-app/src/lib/components/assistants/AssistantForm.test.js`
- Created tests to verify:
  - Default prompt template is set and not empty
  - Required RAG placeholders (`{user_input}` and `{context}`) are present
  - Template format is correct

## Behavior

### For NEW Assistants (Create Mode)
✅ **Prompt Template field is pre-filled** with the default template
✅ Users can see exactly what the template looks like before creating
✅ Users can modify the default if needed
✅ RAG will work out of the box without user having to write a template

### For EXISTING Assistants (Edit Mode)
✅ **No changes to existing data** - the default is NOT applied to assistants that already exist
✅ Existing templates (even if empty) are preserved
✅ Users can manually add or modify templates as before

## Testing
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Changes are backward compatible

## Impact
This enhancement improves the user experience by:
1. Reducing confusion for new users about what to put in the Prompt Template field
2. Providing a working example that demonstrates proper use of RAG placeholders
3. Ensuring RAG functionality works correctly out of the box
4. Maintaining data integrity for existing assistants
